InstagramSelfies
================

An Android Webapp using the Instagram API that displays photos tagged with hashtag #selfie


To test the application-
1. Open it in Chrome.
2. Hit "Get Photos" button. I have pre-filled the text-box with "Selfie" keyword.
3. The sequence and arrangement of images is as - large, small, small... repeat.
4. Tap or mouseover your photos to see the enlarge effect.
